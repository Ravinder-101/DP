DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING
Dynamic programming is basically, recursion plus using common sense. What it means is that recursion allows you to express the value of a function in terms of other values of that function. Where the common sense tells you that if you implement your function in a way that the recursive calls are done in advance, and stored for easy access, it will make your program faster. This is what we call Memoization - it is memorizing the results of some specific states, which can then be later accessed to solve other sub-problems.
